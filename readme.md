    php cicmd add:controller path/Controllername
    php cicmd add:controller path/controllername

The command above will generate a controller file and create a new directory with the name `path` in the `application/controllers/` directory and will contain the controller file with the file name `Controllername.php`. then the controller will be in `application/controllers/path/Controllername.php`. the `/` becomes a separator, the word at the end of `/` will be the Controllername. path can be more than one, for example :

    php cicmd add:controller path/path/controllername

It will generate a controller in `application/controllers/path/path/Controllername.php`.
